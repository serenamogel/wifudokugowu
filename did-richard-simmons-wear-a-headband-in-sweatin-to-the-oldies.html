That is the question.</p><p>One Twitter user asked, “Headband or no headband, which do you remember?” while another asked people to answer without looking it up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Overwhelmingly, many said, “Yes!” In fact, an overwhelming number of responses claimed that Richard definitely wore a headband, and they can all remember it. But are they right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Richard-Simmons-tweets.jpg><p>It’s doubtful that many people still have <a href=#>Richard Simmons</a>‘ Sweatin’ to the Oldies tapes on VHS for this deep dive. In fact, even if we had them, who even owns a VCR anymore?</p><p>Thankfully, there’s an official Richard Simmons YouTube channel, which means that not only can we do this very important research, but we can also get our sweat on with Richard, just like the good old days.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9"></figure><p>What we found is that Richard did not wear a headband in any of the videos we watched for research purposes (and there were several videos checked for this purpose.) Instead, we reminisced while watching Richard move his body in tank tops and tiny shorts.</p><p>That seemed to be his uniform of choice, along with white gym socks, sneakers, and that incredible permed hair that completed his iconic look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is Richard Simmons now?</h2><p>Richard Simmons just turned 75 years old and has been enjoying his retirement, but many fans have been worried about him.</p><p>That’s likely because Richard packed it all up in 2014 and began living a life of solitude without any warning or explanation.</p><p>He just stopped showing up to his Beverly Hills workout studio and hasn’t been seen in public since. It was later reported that Richard was having issues with one of his knees, which is the reason he stopped coming to the studio.</p><p>In the time since, he’s only been heard from a handful of times, including last year when he responded to the <a href=#>New York Post </a>following a documentary about his life called TMZ Investigates: What Really Happened To Richard Simmons?</p><p>Speaking via his rep, Tom Estey, Richard Simmons let his fans know that he is “eternally grateful for the continuous outpouring of love and gratitude he has received from across the Globe. He is happy, healthy and living the life he has chosen to live.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOnaCdZaKesKmt0Z1krKGdoryvv4ywnJqqXZZ6qbHAnZmappRitq950rCcmqyZo3q1u4ytn55ln6GxqrHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-hyland-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Hyland Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danger-diabolik-1968.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danger: Diabolik movie review (1968)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
