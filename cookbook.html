My new cookbook, Love & Lemons Every Day, is out TODAY!! I’m so excited to be sitting here writing this post, because the process of making this book was a long one! About 3 years ago, I set out with SO many ideas that I wanted to pack into this book. Over time, I kept adding more and more… and more. I’d think – “Ooh, this section would be helpful,” or “Oh I’d like to have that information on hand,”&nbsp;and “Let’s add MORE dinner recipes,” etc, etc. As I got carried away, the process got longer, the book…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Hello, happy Saturday!

I haven’t been overly secretive about it, but it’s official… 288 pages of never-been-blogged-before vegetable-ey goodness will be out next April! (I know, I know, a whole year away – I promise it’ll be worth the wait). It’s being published by Penguin US and Penguin Canada, the teams behind some of my favorite books including&nbsp;Oh She Glows and What Katie Ate.

I was new to the idea of blogs, but suddenly I spent all my time at the office procrastinating instead of working. What I was going to make that night for dinner became&nbsp;far&nbsp;more important to me that any client project I had on my plate.

Erin is one of by best blog friends (BBF’s forever!), and I couldn’t be more proud of her and her beautiful new book. She breaks down the basics of making your own flour out of all sorts of grains, seeds, nuts, and legumes.

Although, I’ll admit, I have a hard time following recipes from start to finish. Which is why I love the premise of Kate Payne’s new book,&nbsp;The Hip Girls Guide to the Kitchen. It’s a “hit the ground running approach, seeing as you need to eat three times daily whether you’ve mastered your kitchen or not.” It’s full of, really, everything you need to know to be pretty successful in your kitchen – from how to set up your pantry to how to put meals together intuitively and economically.

Technically it’s fall, but I still have a ton of eggplant, zucchini and other summer vegetables scattered around my countertops. And this rainbow colored vegetable tian was quite possibly the perfect way to celebrate them. (Plus, it was ridiculously fun to make).
