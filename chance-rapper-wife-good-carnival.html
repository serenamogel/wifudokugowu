Chance was spotted enjoying himself at the annual festival and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>dancing with an unidentified woman</a> in the video.</p><p>The video prompted a sea of responses online, with many social media folks accusing Chance of cheating on his spouse.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Ain’t you married?” one user asked on Twitter, while another wrote: “Chancellor where is yo wifeeee” along with a photo of Will Smith wearing an unimpressed look on his face.</p><p>“So is Chance the Rapper still married?? If yes, then bombastic side eye,” wrote another critic.</p><p>However, other fans came to Chance’s defense, reminding the haters that it was Carnaval and that the rapper was just indulging in the culture.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“They’re mad at Chance the Rapper for ‘cheating on his wife,’” tweeted one supporter. “Y’all Don’t bring that European nonsense to this ethnic household and let that man enjoy Caribbean culture.”</p><p>Following the internet controversy, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>the rapper’s wife seemingly responded to the drama via Instagram</a>.

It’s too damn difficult,” it reads. “What happens is most people get older. That’s the truth of it. They honor their credit cards, they find parking spaces, they marry, they have the nerve to have children, but they don’t grow up. Not really.”</p><p>It continues: “They get older. But to grow up costs the earth, the earth. It means you take responsibility for the time you take up, for the space you occupy. It’s serious business. And you find out what it costs us to love and to lose, to dare and to fail. And maybe even more, to succeed.”</p><p>Corley-Bennett added in the caption: “I hope one day, we all choose to grow up.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/chance-rapper-acid-rap-10th-anniversary-concert-saba-250x142.jpg alt="Chance The Rapper Announces ‘Acid Rap’ 10th Anniversary Concert With Saba" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Chance The Rapper Announces ‘Acid Rap’ 10th Anniversary Concert With Saba</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 25, 2023</p></a><p>As for Chance, <a href=# rel=noopener>he seemed to respond to the controversy via his Instagram Stories</a> on Friday (April 28), sharing a clip of comedian Bill Burr in which Burr spoke candidly about his own marriage.</p><p>“I love my wife to death.
