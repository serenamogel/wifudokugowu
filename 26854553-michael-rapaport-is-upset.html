This rapist was a maniac and had a very long rap sheet and could have easily killed someone trying to intervene. What if the guy filming was a DL queen in a caftan and that was the most heroic act he could muster? At least the video helped catch this cretin fast and get him off the streets temporarily until some lenient judge gives him bail which I hope never happens. The video will be good evidence if the DA chooses to prosecute and not offer a short jail plea bargain, which I also hope never happens.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 9</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 31, 2020 1:10 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>MR was never good looking, but now he's fugly.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 10</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 31, 2020 1:51 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>R10, I saw the photo at the top of the page and my first thought was, Jesus, Victor Garber is looking rough nowadays.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 11</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 31, 2020 2:06 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Monday morning quarterback over here.</p><p>Recently I was on the bus when an obviously deranged man was race-baiting the other passengers. He was getting verbally aggressive with a white teen girl (who was keeping her composure). A big black man stepped near the man and grabbed a pole so he was shielding the girl. It was subtle, but everyone understood the message. I wanted to hug that man so hard. With everything going on right now, it was a generous gesture and I think everyone appreciated it.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 12</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 31, 2020 2:07 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I am accosted several times a week by a black bag lady who hangs in my neighborhood. She calls me the white devil and all sorts of other racially charged insults, that is the least offensive of what she says. I so want to call her the N word and to shut the fuck up, but that is not what Bill DeBlasio would want me to do. So far I just endure the abuse and keep it moving, but it is getting harder everytime. All bets are off if the fat witch ever tries to physically hurt me though.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 13</td><td class=timestamp><span>August 31, 2020 4:12 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Hey, R13!
