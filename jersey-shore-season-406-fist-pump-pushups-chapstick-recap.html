After going through withdrawal for the past week or so, it’s great to finally watch the roommates again.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>The episode begins with Mike explaining how walls are very hard and you should never, EVER ram your head into them to make a point. And of course, Ronnie runs into Sam’s room to apologize for the last night, meaning that we’ll never see the end of this relationship. While Mike wallows in his own puddle of pity, Pauly D and Vinny take time to make fun of him, and it’s absolutely hilarious.</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>But then, Mike calls his sister Melissa and talks about coming home. Would he ever actually leave though? As the girls head out to lunch, they also discuss how much they hate Mike. Back at the house, Ron talks to Mike about how much it sucks to be alone, and Mike actually breaks down and has an actual show of emotions with Ron. It’s actually kind of amazing to see them have a heart to heart. After all of this, Ronnie convinces Mike to stay, which is surprisingly exactly what I was hoping for.</p><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Back in the streets of Italy, a priest tells Snooki to cover up by his church, a random but awesome moment. Snooki calls her&nbsp;boyfriend, Jionni, and tells him she loves him in her own words (which are…uhmm…interesting), prompting him to call her stupid. Since Ron is the acting therapist for this episode, he’s the one who Snooki confides in about her reservations with Jionni. Ronnie is winning in brownie points for the episode so far. Deena gives Pauly D a new hairdo, and him and Vinny decide to dress up like “guido toolbags” so they can make fun of…well…themselves.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>And now it’s time for Ron and Sam to sit and talk like adults, which means they argue and argue and argue. Even Vinny, Pauly and Deena are sick of it, which is a good sign that maybe they should just break up. Thinking this, Ron gives Sam the ultimatum he’s given her before, and everybody hopes this time she’ll really walk away.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Now that Ron is busy, Vinny steps in and asks them to stop fighting around everyone, which they actually respect and decide to honor. It’s really odd to see everybody acting like normal people this episode. Oh, and Ron and Sam are back together after that huge fight (sigh).</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/4_snooki.jpg alt width=600 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Ron and JWOWW discuss Jionni and Snooki’s relationship, which is looking pretty bleak. And speaking of bleak relationships, Mike makes a terrible attempt at apologizing to Snooki about telling the house that they slept together. Of course, Snooki denies it because Mike can’t physically say the words “I’m sorry.”</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>To ease the tension, the group makes a club run, but even this can’t be peaceful. While there, Deena and Snooki get in a fight with a girl who throws a drink at them. When they get back to the house, Snooki calls Jionni, which goes about as well as it should. He accuses her of cheating for no reason, so Ron tries to step in and make things better by telling Jionni that Snooki loves him. But of course, Jionni continues to yell at Snooki, which is starting to annoy the roommates as well.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, Deena invites her friend Elis over, even though she’s drunk off her rocks right now. After they start talking, Deena finds a hickey on Elis, which he insists is from his sister. Definitely not helping your case, kid. So goodbye Elis. JWOWW calls her boyfriend Roger and talks to him about the whole Snooki/Jionni debacle, and he gives the advice that they should break up. The whole house agrees, and they decide to have an intervention for Snooki.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>However, the intervention fails. Badly. Snooki defends Jionni, and it looks like she’s going to decide to stay with him. Despite this bummer ending, next week’s episode looks truly awesome. The roommates are all heading to the beach, there’s some “lesbionic” making out, and Snooki and Deena ram an Italian cop car. Who else is excited?</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=false>Leave your thoughts on this week’s episode in the comments below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrsdGsnLJlo528s7GMrJyaq5%2BjenV8lWadoqukYr22uc9mp66rmKq9tHnCoZipq6SesKx50Z6amqhf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./loralean-jordan-obituary-minnesota-death-cause.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Loralean Jordan Obituary Minnesota Death Cause: Family Mourns The Loss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phison-to-unveil-14-7-gb-s-pcie-5-0-ssd-and-cheap-usb4-drives-at-ces-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Phison To Unveil 14.7 GB/s PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cheap USB4 Drives at CES 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
