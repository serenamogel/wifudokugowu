Samaresh was also credited with creating investigator Arjun, the lead character of the 2013 film Arjun – Kalimpong E Sitaharan.</strong></p><p>The Bengali film Buno Haansh, which premiered on August 15, 2014, was influenced by his piece of the same name, which was published in Pujabarshiki Anondolok. His efforts in the book “Kalbela,” which is based on the Naxalite uprising, earned him the “Sahitya Akademi Award.”</p><p>Young kids and adults alike really like Majumdar’s detective character, Arjun. West Bengal’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, offered her condolences on Majumdar’s departure and described it as an irreparable loss to the literary world.</p><h2>Who Is the Wife of Samaresh Majumdar? His Family Information</h2><p>There is no information online about Samaresh Majumdar’s wife. Mazumdar was raised in the Dooars, Gairkata tea gardens in the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, India.

Mazumdar is a diverse author, yet many of his works have suspense and thrills in them.
