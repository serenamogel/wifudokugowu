For as many <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity couples</a></strong> who get together and break up, leaving a path of heartbroken fans in their wake, there are a few who prove longevity is still attainable in an environment as fast-paced, tempting, and sometimes superficial as public life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>We will always have the classic happily married celebrity couples who have been together for decades like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Denzel and Pauletta Washington, or Wanda and Alex Sykes, but there are plenty of younger pairings who have been teaching us all a thing or two about love the past couple of years.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>In this list, we’ve compiled a mix of newer and more established famous couples that we just love to root for, and who renew our belief in love with every adorable public appearance, or Instagram post —<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">although, we’re now starting to think we might have hurt their chances at long-lasting love with this article</a>.</p><h2 id=h-zendaya-and-tom-holland data-injectable=false>Zendaya and Tom Holland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zendaya-tom-holland.jpg><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Officially together since 2021, Tom Holland and Zendaya are Hollywood’s biggest “it” couple at the moment. From the sidelines, we have watched as these two developed a close friendship after meeting on the set of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, all the while thinking they would make the cutest couple.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Our intuition checked out, and as they allow glimpses into their romance here and there, we can’t help but grow more endeared every time. The two seem to be very in love when they are spotted out and about, mention each other in interviews, or make rare but meaningful declarations on social media. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This is definitely a couple we hope stays together for a really long time.</a></p><h2 id=h-beyonce-and-jay-z data-injectable=false>Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/beyonce-and-jay-z-resized.jpg><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>When the topic is longevity, Queen B and Jay-Z have to get a mention. Their time together hasn’t been without tribulations, but they have been a mainstay in lists like this one for almost two decades now. The fact that they’re arguably the two biggest names in the music industry on their own, and even stronger when they come together, is also a huge factor in making Beyoncé and Jay-Z the ultimate power couple.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Ever since getting together in 2000, the two have had three children — Blue Ivy, Rumi, and Sir — founded their own record labels, and produced some of the most iconic musical moments in this century, positively shaping the industry as we know it, both behind-the-scenes and on stage. Their very public cheating scandal, which is documented in Beyoncé’s 2016 album Lemonade and Jay-Z’s 2017 title 4:44 was the rockiest period in a relationship that has been otherwise remarkably solid.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black-resized.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black are actually the cutest. The fact that the Olympic diver is also a successful YouTuber has allowed us a different kind of look into Daley and Black’s relationship from when the former first publicly came out as gay, to their engagement, wedding, and the birth of their son Robbie Ray.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>They have been madly in love since meeting in 2013, which Black has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously described</a> as “love at first sight.” They got married in 2017 and welcomed Robbie into their lives a year later. Their lives are divided between London, where the sportsman trains, and L.A., where the screenwriter and producer usually works. The couple are both advocates and activists for LGBT+ rights.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Update: Tom, Lance and Robbie’s family has gained a new member in baby boy Phoenix, who was born in March 2023!</p><h2 id=h-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn data-injectable=false>Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-resized.jpg><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>No other celebrity has had their dating life be subject to more scrutiny than Taylor Swift. Chastised for dating in her teens and 20s (how could she?!), Swift seems to have finally found the one in dazzling British actor Joe Alwyn.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>They met at the Met Gala in 2016 and got together a few months later. They’re both very protective of their relationship and barely make public appearances together, but attentive fans have picked up sweet details in Swift’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-personal song lyrics that indicate that they’re in it for the long haul</a>. Alwyn even occasionally contributes to his girlfriend’s albums with lyrics and melodies under the pseudonym William Bowery.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Update: Taylor and Joe did unfortunately let the flame burn out when they went their separate ways in April 2023.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Henry and Liv Lo Golding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/henry-and-liv-lo-golding-resized.jpg><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Henry Golding became one of Hollywood’s most fancied actors after his breakout role in Crazy Rich Asians, but by then his heart had always been taken by TV host and yoga instructor Liv Lo, to whom he’s been married for almost seven years.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>They met in 2011 at a party, where Liv made the first move. She told Henry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Hi, I am leaving and you’re never going to see me again,”</a> and so their love story began. The two are quite open about their relationship on social media, sharing adorable moments and confessions of love and admiration. When their baby girl Lyla was born in 2021, the Snake Eyes actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t spare any compliments</a> when it came to his wife. They <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make the absolute cutest family</a>.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>Update: Henry and Liv are expecting another baby! Congratulations to the happy couple.</p><h2 id=h-blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds data-injectable=false>Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Blake-Lively-Ryan-Reynolds-resized.jpg><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>Of course, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are on this list. They have been raising the standards for us all for a little over a decade, with barely any drama. They say laughter is the best aphrodisiac and their relationship definitely proves it as the two are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly pranking, trolling, and poking fun at each other</a>.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>Although they don’t take themselves too seriously, they’re definitely serious about their relationship. With four children, Lively and Reynolds have been together for 12 years. They began dating a year after meeting on the set of Green Lantern in 2010, and Reynolds has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the friendship they built during that time has been the secret to a long-lasting romance.</p><h2 id=h-emily-blunt-and-john-krasinski data-injectable=false>Emily Blunt and John Krasinski</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emily-blunt-john-krasinski-resized.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are another staple of favorite celebrity couples lists. Sparks flew instantly when the two met in 2008 through a mutual friend, and less than a year later they were engaged. They now have two daughters and have gone on to work together extensively in the Quiet Place franchise.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Blunt and Krasinski’s relationship, by their own accord, is one based on mutual trust and support. Blunt’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">emotional speech</a> when she won a SAG award for her work in A Quiet Place, which her husband directed, is a perfect example of their loving partnership. Meanwhile, Krasinski can’t stop <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">complimenting</a> his wife’s acting talent “superpower.” They are the definition of “goals”.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kristen-stewart-dylan-meyer-resized.jpg><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=true>Marriage never appealed to Kristen Stewart until she met screenwriter Dylan Meyer. “When you know, you know,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Howard Stern</a> only months after the two had begun dating. They met in 2013 but didn’t see each other for six years after that. When they reconnected, it only took Stewart two weeks to confess her love, and a couple of months to start planning a proposal. “I can’t f–cking wait [to propose],” she said in Nov. 2019. In the end, it was Meyer who popped the question, and the two have been engaged since 2021.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>The two seem to be two peas in a pod and a perfect match. Together, they’re one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coolest, weirdest, and quirkiest</a> couples in Hollywood. Now we’re just waiting for the day Kristen stars in a film written by Meyer.</p><h2 id=h-joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner data-injectable=false>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-resized.jpg><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Also up there on the cool scale are Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who have somehow collected the two best possible wedding scenarios – eloping in Las Vegas, and a grandiose French countryside ceremony. The “Cake By the Ocean” singer and the Game of Thrones actress’ truly modern romance began when the former slid into the latter’s Instagram DMs. It took one date for them to become inseparable.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Whether they’re turning up looking incredible at fashion shows, or together at movie premieres or the Jonas Brothers’ concerts, Jonas and Turner are one of their generation’s most refreshing and loved-up couples. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They have since had two babies together</a>, and continue to show up and show out for one another.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Update: Sophie and Joe are also among the couples from this list to have broken our hearts when news of their divorce came out in September 2023.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>King Princess and Quinn Wilson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/king-princess-quinn-wilson-resized.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>When King Princess, whose real name is Mikaela Straus, and Quinn Wilson were featured in GQ’s 2021 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Modern Lovers” issue</a>, the creative producer bared it all. “I love Mikaela so much it’s painful. She’s my best friend,” she said. For such a young couple, whose lives are fast-paced, loud, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">colorful</a>, their commitment to each other ever since they started dating in 2019 is heartwarming to see.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>Straus and Wilson might just be the hottest Gen Z power couple, whose irreverence in everything they do and are, from their careers and their relationship to their activism and their style, is massively inspiring. Like many of the couples on this list, they have also gone on to work together in some of Straus’ music videos, like the one for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Pain”</a> and “Too Bad / Cursed,” which Wilson directed.</p><h2 id=h-a-ap-rocky-and-rihanna data-injectable=false>A$AP Rocky and Rihanna</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rihanna-asap-rocky.jpg><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were one of those relationships we were all just waiting to happen. The two were friends for years before Rihanna reportedly gave Rocky a chance and things became romantic. The rapper seems to be head over heels in love, calling the singer the “love of my life,” and “the one,” in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ interview</a> in 2021.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>In 2022, the couple had a baby boy together, which Rocky has described as “heaven.” Although their relationship is still relatively young, the two always look very happy together every time they make public appearances. We’re definitely rooting for their happiness!</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Update: Rihanna and Rocky are actually defeating the curse and have welcomed another baby boy into the family, Riot, in August 2023.</p><h2 id=h-leigh-anne-pinnock-and-andre-gray data-injectable=false>Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Andre Gray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/leigh-anne-pinnock-andre-gray-resized.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>The ladies of the British girl band Little Mix are all happily coupled up, and any one of their relationships would be a great fit for the topic of this list. There’s something about Andre Gray and Leigh-Anne Pinnock’s relationship, though, that just has us swooning every time. The footballer and the singer obviously look great together, but their partnership seems to be all about teamwork and that ride-or-die mindset.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>After getting together in 2016, Pinnock and Gray’s relationship rapidly turned serious. With the musician always being family-oriented, it was only a matter of time until they took the next step. They became engaged in 2020 and had twins in the summer of 2021. Pinnock always gushes about her beau, calling him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“the best thing to ever happen to me.”</a></p><h2 id=h-hayley-kiyoko-and-becca-tilley data-injectable=false>Hayley Kiyoko and Becca Tilley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hayley-kiyoko-becca-tilley-resized.jpg><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Hayley Kiyoko and Becca Tilley were together for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four years</a> before they finally decided to take their relationship public. The Bachelor star would refer to the “For The Girls” singer by code name “95p” on her podcast, which came from her saying she was 95 percent sure she was going to marry the person she was with.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>The two have kept the details of their relationship and how it came to be deliberately private, but ever since going Instagram official, they have allowed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some glimpses into the four years they have shared together</a>, and it’s just the cutest thing in the world. We will all be waiting on that engagement announcement now so that Kiyoko can go from “95p” to “100p.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Becky G and Sebastian Lletget</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sebastian-Lletget-and-Becky-G.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Becky G and Sebastian Lletget are just impossibly cute. Although the two have been together for almost seven years, they are just as in love as ever if the singer’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lovesick Instagram posts</a> are anything to go by. The FC Dallas soccer player proposed to the “Shower” singer at the end of last year at the Manhattan Beach pier, where they had their first date.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>The two have continuously spoken about the support they feel from one another as one conquers the field and the other the stage. Not only are they romantic partners, but they’re also the best of friends. Becky has said Lletget <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">always empowers her and uplifts her in her career</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he leans on her when the going gets tough in the strenuous world of sports</a>.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=false>Update: While we don’t know for sure whether Becky and Sebastian have broken off their engagement, the rumors that the player cheated on the singer definitely stung.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S8tr6MamtmnpGrvLO1055knJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJynpaW5pr%2BMsJ%2BoZZGnsm680aitoqaXYrmwwsRmoKympGKxpq3DZqCnZWJlf3R7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amara-la-negra.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LHHMs Amara La Negra Net Worth Earnings, Bragging Jewelry and Limousine Standard</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./misha-aryn-net-worth-310630.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Misha Aryn Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
