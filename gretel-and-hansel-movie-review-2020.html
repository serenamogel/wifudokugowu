(“Dig yourself some pretty little graves.”) They spend one night with a kindly woodsman (<a href=#>Charles Babalola</a>) who gives them food, directions, and sage advice but the journey is long and arduous, lightened only by a brief respite when they consume some wild mushrooms with certain unexpected qualities.&nbsp;</p><p>Just when all seems lost for the two, they stumble upon a house in the middle of nowhere and spy a lavish and seemingly unattended feast sitting on the table just waiting for someone to eat. This is the home of Holda (<a href=#>Alice Krige</a>), a strange older woman who invites the two in to eat and take refuge. While Hansel is more concerned with filling his belly to notice anything else, even when his host appears to be sniffing his hair, Gretel picks up right from the start that strange things are afoot. The house seems way bigger on the inside than logic should dictate. The enormous spread of food never seems to abate despite the lack of any garden or livestock on or around the premises. And while Gretel has always odd dreams and premonitions, they take on a decidedly darker turn the longer that they stay with Holda. You probably think you know where this is going from here. You may not be correct in your assumptions.</p><p>“Gretel & Hansel” is the third film from director Osgood Perkins, whose previous efforts included “The Blackcoat’s Daughter” and “<a href=#>I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House</a>.” Neither of those movies quite worked for me, I admit, but they did do enough to suggest that he was an intriguing new directorial voice who was clearly on the cusp of doing something really interesting once he got a hold of the right material. With this film, he has done that and the results are often startlingly good. The screenplay by <a href=#>Rob Hayes</a> takes the familiar narrative and finds a fresh approach, leaning towards a feminist take on the tale that may not exactly be subtle at times (her symbolic passage from childhood to womanhood is prefigured by the appearance of a long wooden staff and a vat of mysterious viscous goo that is perhaps the most over-the-top touch in the otherwise subdued story)&nbsp;but it does offer up an audacious and often surprising slant to the proceedings. As much as it is a horror story, this perspective allows the film to also work as a thoughtful coming-of-age tale of a young woman gradually realizing that she does have power after all, and can use it to make a path into the world that is entirely of her own design.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gqZ6slaF6orrDZp%2BapqOauW65zq%2BgnmWimsOqsdZmaWlqYA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tatiana-dieteman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tatiana Dieteman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-nash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Nash Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
