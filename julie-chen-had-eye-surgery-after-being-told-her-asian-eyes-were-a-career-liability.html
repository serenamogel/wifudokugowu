She’s married Les Moonves, the president of CBS, so Chen often comes across as that well-connected trophy wife who thinks SHE is in charge of everything because her husband is so very important.</p><p>So, that was all background because I really don’t know what to think of Chen’s new admission that she had plastic surgery on her eyelids when she was first starting out in television. That kind of surgery has become increasingly popular in many Asian countries – the surgeons do something to the eyelids to make the eyes look more Anglo, wider, bigger.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chen1.jpg alt title=chen1 width=534 height=401 sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Julie Chen’s secret is out. The hosts of The Talk have been sharing surprising revelations this week, and on Wednesday, Sept. 11, it was Chen’s turn to ‘fess up. Speaking with her co-hosts in what turned out to be an emotional episode, the veteran journalist disclosed that she had undergone plastic surgery nearly 20 years earlier in order to make her “Asian eyes” look bigger.</p><p>“My secret dates back to — my heart is racing — it dates back to when I was 25 years old and I was working as a local news reporter in Dayton, Ohio,” the 43-year-old Chinese-American television personality began. “I asked my news director over the holidays, ‘If anchors want to take vacations, could I fill in?’ And he said, ‘You will never be on this anchor desk, because you’re Chinese.”</p><p>“He said, ‘Let’s face it, Julie, how relatable are you to our community? How big of an Asian community do we have in Dayton?'” she recalled. “‘On top of that, because of your heritage, because of your Asian eyes, sometimes I’ve noticed when you’re on camera and you’re interviewing someone, you look disinterested, you look bored.'”</p><p>Not long after, Chen started looking for another job. But she ran into the same problem when she tried to find an agent to represent her. “This one big-time agent basically told me the same thing,” she revealed. “He said, ‘I cannot represent you unless you get plastic surgery to make your eyes look bigger.'”</p><p>Chen’s career was important to her, so she took the agent’s advice to heart and considered her options. “[My parents and I] had a long conversation about if it would be denying my heritage,” she said. “You know, my mom calls one auntie, my father calls an uncle…it spread to my entire family. It divided the family. Members of my family wanted to disown me if I got it done.”</p><p>Wanting to someday sit behind an anchor desk, she had the surgery anyway. And afterward, “the ball did roll” for her career, she confessed. “And I wondered, did I give in to the man?”</p><p>Regardless, she has no regrets. “No one’s more proud of being Chinese than I am,” she told her co-hosts. “And I have to live with the decisions I’ve made. Every decision I’ve made…it got [me] to where we are today, and I’m not going to look back.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>What a horrible story. Not for what she had done surgically – but for what her bosses and her agent told her! God. I can’t believe that’s really a “thing” that would have been (and perhaps still is?) discussed openly, like her boss would have told her that she didn’t have the right kind of eyes to be a TV anchor. As for the surgery she had… I don’t really see much of difference in her eyes. But I’m pretty sure she got a nose job at the same time, right? THAT is what is noticeable. Anyway, her body, her choice. And I can understand why she had the surgery if her g—damn bosses were telling her it would help her career.</p><p></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20444867.jpg alt title=wenn20444867 width=520 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, The Talk.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGpiaH9xe8muo6Kdj5i1prq%2BoZidl5WusqC%2F1KuenqqplK6nwMSrlpudmaO0oMDOpZuYoJWnrKK%2FyJqlmJ2pmsCgw8SrnJiZj5ius7HEq5aloZGXtq2107Jm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobbie-houston-net-worth-biography-age-wiki-family-pastor-brian-houston-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobbie Houston Net Worth, Biography, Age, Wiki, Family: Pastor Brian Houston Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deadpool-3-leak-teasing-double-the-daredevil-crossovers-confirms-its-everything-we-ever-wanted.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deadpool 3 leak teasing double the Daredevil crossovers confirms its everything we ev</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
