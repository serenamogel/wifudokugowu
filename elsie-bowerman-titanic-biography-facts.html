One of the lucky ones was Elsie Bowerman, a 22-year-old British woman. After surviving the disaster, Bowerman went on to participate in and witness major historical events; she also got to experience the broader opportunities for women in the 20th century. Here's a look at a remarkable life that fortunately wasn't cut short:</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Bowerman and her mother were in the safe lifeboat as the 'Unsinkable' Molly Brown</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1912, Bowerman decided to leave England and cross the Atlantic because she and her mother wanted to visit friends and family in America and Canada. Unfortunately, when the two women embarked upon their journey on April 10, 1912, it was on the Titanic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Booking passage on that ship was certainly an unlucky choice, but Bowerman and her mother were in the best possible position onboard. Not only would they benefit from the nautical code of "women and children first," as first-class passengers, they would also be first in line for lifeboats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early morning hours of April 15th, Bowerman and her mother left the Titanic in lifeboat six. The boat could have held 65 people, but instead, it only carried two men, a boy and 21 women, one of whom was the famous <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/molly-brown data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Unsinkable" Molly Brown' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"Unsinkable" Molly Brown</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bowerman later wrote about the experience: "The silence when the engines stopped was followed by a steward knocking on our door and telling us to go on deck. This we did and were lowered into lifeboats, where we were told to get away from the liner as soon as we could in case of suction. This we did, and to pull an oar in the midst of the Atlantic in April with icebergs floating about, is a strange experience."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After rowing on the Atlantic, Bowerman and the others were rescued by another ship, the Carpathia.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She fought for women's rights</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even before boarding the Titanic, Bowerman had been on history's cutting edge. In 1909, she'd joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a group headed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/emmeline-pankhurst data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emmeline Pankhurst" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> that was fighting for women to get the right to vote in England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bowerman shared her commitment to enfranchising women while studying at Girton College at Cambridge University. In one letter, she wrote, "I always wear my badge in as conspicuous a position as possible in lectures." After leaving Girton in 1911, Bowerman became an organizer for the WSPU. And she continued her involvement with the organization after her ill-fated voyage on the Titanic.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Bowerman contributed during wartime</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The outbreak of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War I" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War I</a> changed the political landscape in Britain. Following the example of other WSPU members, Bowerman stepped away from the fight for female suffrage in order to support the war effort. For her wartime contribution, she joined a Scottish women's hospital unit and traveled to Romania.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bowerman's unit ended up retreating to Russia, so she was in St. Petersburg for another key moment in history: the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/russia/russian-revolution data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Russian Revolution of 1917" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>. She described seeing "great excitement in street – armoured cars rushing up and down – soldiers and civilians marching up and down armed – attention suddenly focused on our hotel & house next door – rain of shots directed on to both buildings as police supposed to be shooting from top storeys – most exciting."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She became a lawyer</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After World War I, women in England were granted limited voting rights, and soon other opportunities opened up for the female half of the population. For example, in 1919 the Sex Disqualification Act allowed women to enter professions that had previously barred them, such as accounting and the law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bowerman took advantage of this development and trained to become a lawyer; she was admitted to the bar in 1924. She went on to become the first female barrister to practice at the Old Bailey, a famous London courthouse.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She served during WWII and helped set up the United Nations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she did during the First World War, Bowerman offered up her talents during World War II. Her work included the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and a position at the Ministry of Information. Bowerman also joined the BBC, serving as the liaison officer for its North American Service from 1941 to 1945.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the war ended, the United Nations was formed. Bowerman was tapped to help set up the organization's Commission on the Status of Women in 1947.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A portrait of her was discovered in 2016</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, a small portrait of Bowerman, who died in 1973, was discovered and put up for auction (it was given an estimated price of £1,000, but sold for £2,000 in March 2016). During the auction process, a link to the Titanic was uncovered — it turns out that auctioneer Timothy Medhurst was the great-great-grandson of Robert Hichens, a quartermaster who'd been in lifeboat six with Bowerman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before the auction, Medhurst noted, "It is a wonderful thing to be able to look at the same lady who would have looked at my great-great-grandfather over 100 years ago on board a lifeboat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean." The Titanic connection is also a reminder that Bowerman and other survivors experienced a providential escape — Bowerman only went on to vote, have a career and serve her country because she was fortunate enough to survive that long-ago April night. Who knows what her fellow ill-fated passengers might have achieved themselves had that unlucky ship managed to stay afloat?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJonKWrmZp6o7vWnqmmmZ5iwarAwKegnGWSnryovsCpn7Jllpawtb8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwes-end-game-mmas-4-horsewomen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWEs End Game For MMAs 4 Horsewomen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meyers-leonard-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meyers Leonard Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
