I watched a video of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Kendall</a>&nbsp;when she was three, and she was putting on makeup. I don’t know how I feel about that. But my daughter already watches me do it. When do you let them start wearing it? I don’t know yet.”</p><p>“I’ve been applying makeup long enough to feel good doing it on my own, but I cannot do my hair to save my life. When left to my own devices, if I have to go to an event, I do a slicked bun. Otherwise, I just try to wear a hat, put it in a ponytail, or do a side braid – something easy.”&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no one else I would rather have as my manager than my mom because I know that she has our best interests at heart. Sometimes, it’s hard to separate manager mode from mom mode. I think as our manager, my mom will get more emotional about situations than she would if she was just our manager.”</p><p>“I remember, when I went away to college at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, my aunt sent me a book with the rules of being a Southern Belle. One of the rules was to never wear white after Labor Day. Fashion has a lot to do with confidence and making up your own rules.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Billy Corgan Net Worth 2022: How Much Money Does Billy Corgan Make?</a></li><li><a href=#>Zdeno Chara Net Worth 2022: Bio/wiki, Career, And How Much Money Has Zdeno Chara Made?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6C8tr7Tp5yyZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqZdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-1706-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tamara Manhoef Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-james-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin James Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
