After graduating in 2008, Pippa worked at a public relations firm, then as an event planner in London. She married hedge fund manager James Matthews on May 20, 2017.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Philippa Charlotte Middleton in Reading, Berkshire, England, on September 6, 1983, Pippa Middleton is the second of three children of Carole and Michael Middleton. Middleton's older sister, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/kate-middleton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kate class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kate</a>, was born in 1982 and is the Duchess of Cambridge through her marriage to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-william data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince William" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince William</a>. Her younger brother James, born in 1987, is a businessman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Middleton's parents met working for British Airways — Carole was a flight attendant, and Michael was first a flight attendant, then a flight dispatcher. In 1984, the couple moved to Amman, Jordan, where they were based briefly. In 1987, the Middleton family was back in England, living at Bradfield Southend in the county of Berkshire. Carole started a company called Party Pieces, selling decorations and accessories for children's parties. Middleton and her siblings got their first taste of the spotlight modeling for Party Pieces catalogs. Party Pieces went on to become a successful business.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like her older sister, Middleton attended Britain's elite schools, first at St. Andrew's School in Pangbourne, then Downe House, a girls' boarding school, and then Marlborough College at Wiltshire. She was known as an organized and attentive student and the more outgoing of the Middleton sisters. Though they were reportedly bullied at times, Middleton was popular with her fellow students. Middleton studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh, where she mixed with the children of the dukes and earls — her group of friends was known as the "castle crew." She dated George Percy, the son of the Duke of Northumberland. Percy's family castle was used as Hogwarts castle in the Harry Potter films.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rise to Fame</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating in 2008, Middleton worked at a public relations firm, then as an event planner in London. She was often spotted out at London's poshest nightclubs and on the arm of handsome young aristocrats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was Middleton's sister, Kate, who changed the family's fortunes for good. As a freshman at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, Kate befriended and began dating, a young Prince William.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Britons paid close attention to the future king's romance, Middleton became a familiar face. Often spotted out shopping with her sister, or partying with the same group of people at London nightclubs, Middleton's good looks and sense of style earned her many fans, as well as critics. Dubbed the "wisteria sisters," Kate and Middleton were criticized for what some perceived as social climbing. Seen out and about frequently, Middleton became a paparazzi favorite.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Royal Wedding</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The November 2010 announcement of the engagement of Prince William and Kate caused a national frenzy in Britain. Always close to her sister, Middleton reportedly helped Kate plan many of the details of the royal wedding and the reception.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Bridesmaid Dress</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the much-anticipated wedding took place at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, many eyes were on the bride's younger sister — and Middleton, as the maid of honor, didn't disappoint. Dressed in a slinky white dress by Sarah Burton at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/alexander-mcqueen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alexander McQueen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alexander McQueen</a>, Middleton held her sister's train and chatted with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-harry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Harry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince Harry</a> during the televised ceremony. Her beau, stockbroker and former cricketer Alex Loudon, sat beside her in the front row at the ceremony. The rave reviews of Middleton's dress — and her figure — rivaled the enthusiasm for the bride's gown.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Middleton has been romantically linked to George Percy, the son of the Duke of Northumberland, and J.J. Jardine Paterson, the son of a banking family. She dated hedge fund manager James Matthews in 2012. After their split, she dated banker Nico Jackson from 2013 to 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Middleton and Jackson ended their relationship, she and Matthews began dating again. On July 17, 2016, Middleton and Matthews announced their engagement and plans to marry in 2017. Matthews is the son of Scottish nobleman David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric, an honorary title his son will inherit. When he acquires the title, Middleton will receive the title Lady Glen Affric.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple married on May 20, 2017, at St. Mark’s Church in the village of Englefield, near Reading. Big sister, Prince William, Prince Harry and other notables like tennis star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/roger-federer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roger Federer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roger Federer</a> were in attendance.

The mom-to-be confirmed the news in June with a column in the publication Waitrose Weekend, titled, "Exercising during pregnancy."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Middleton and Matthews welcomed their first child, son Arthur, on October 15, 2018, and daughter, Grace, on March 15, 2021.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1983</li><li>Birth date: September 6, 1983</li><li>Birth City: Reading, Berkshire, England</li><li>Birth Country: United Kingdom</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Pippa Middleton is best known as the younger sister of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Virgo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of Edinburgh</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=28><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Pippa Middleton Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/celebrities/pippa-middleton</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 14, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e8%2Bip6mZXaK2pbDLnquopg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-akerlof-wife-who-is-janet-yellen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Akerlof Wife: Who Is Janet Yellen?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clarksons-farm-season-3-release-date-trailer-cast-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clarksons Farm season 3 release date, trailer, cast, and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
