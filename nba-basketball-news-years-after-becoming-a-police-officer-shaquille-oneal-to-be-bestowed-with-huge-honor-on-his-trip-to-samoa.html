The Lakers legend would be bestowed with the Samoan chief title during his visit to support a local sports tournament. The matai (chief) title is a prestigious honor given to reputable leaders and decision-makers of the Samoan community. Moreover, the chief title is also bestowed upon people who have served the local community or the nation, including non-Samoans.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1156009561.jpg><p><span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>As per NZ Herald</a>, “Speaking to Samoa’s Eye Spy Radio station, Tumanuvao said the title would come from his own village, Leulumoega, and would be a token of the trip for the Samoa Games.”</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, photos of Shaquille O’Neal with traditional items reserved for the chief surfaced on Facebook.
