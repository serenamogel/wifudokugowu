The tweet read: “All these girls the same ain’t no wayy” along with a crying face emoji.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>It didn’t take long for fans to notice DDG had wiped his Instagram clean of any photos with Bailey, as well as the fact that they were no longer following each other on the social media platform. DDG seemingly refollowed the singer after going viral, and people believed he implied that Halle cheated, which her fans didn’t take too lightly.</p><p>“Ddg tweeting like we was gon stick beside him against THE halle bailey like be fr,” someone wrote, while another said, “DDG will soon realize.

Last November, DDG told The Breakfast Club why he was so enamored with Bailey.</p><p>“I’ve never been with nobody that’s like really motivated me like she do,” he said at the time. “I’m seeing different shit. I ain’t really been around this type of shit before. So, it’s like, she’s bringing me around shit that I ain’t really—you know what I’m saying?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He added: “I was my own person before her, but in a way, she put me on to different shit.
