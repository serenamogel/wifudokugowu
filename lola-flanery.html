They were upset that the lesbian character was gotten rid of the show very quickly which made many believe that the show was excluding their group from the mainstream show.</p><p>However, that was just the beginning of the controversy of <i>The 100</i> as the <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Hollywood Reporter</i></a> has mentioned in their article that one of the actors of the show, <strong>Ricky Whittle </strong>alleged that the show maker <strong>Jason Rothenberg </strong>was a bully and had bullied him while working on the show.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Lola Flanery is present on social media through the platform, Instagram and Twitter.
