Rather than being based on a single manga or novel – although the franchise has expanded to serialize these – Psycho-Pass was inspired by multiple live-action films, most notably, the original Blade Runner. The series has been around since 2012, with its latest entry appearing in 2023. However, the series’ rocky release history in the West has led to some fans simply not realizing that there is more&nbsp;Psycho-Pass&nbsp;to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Here are a few ways in which one can experience the unsettling but intriguing world of Psycho-Pass.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-psycho-pass-about data-injectable=false>What is Psycho-Pass about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Psycho-Pass&nbsp;is set in a futuristic fictional version of Japan wherein criminal activity has become a rarity. By all means having less crime should be a positive thing, right? Well, Psycho-Pass is a dystopia for a reason, instead of introducing you to its rotten sides from the get-go, it progressively peels back the curtain to show viewers, often in brutal ways, just how rotten some facets of the society the Sybil System created and oversees really are.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>The Psycho-Pass is an evaluation of a given individual’s mental stability that yields a qualitative number, the Crime Coefficient index, appraising how likely a person is to resort to crime. Sounds great in theory as a preventive measure right? Well, this wouldn’t be a dystopia if it were all sunshine and rainbows. The system that governs this seemingly peaceful society has loopholes that will find their way to sucker-punch you when you least expect.</p><p data-characters=671 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>If your Crime Coefficient is too high, you become a fugitive of the law. In the best-case scenario, your Coefficient isn’t past 299 and you’ll be arrested and thrown in jail. Worst-case scenario, your Coefficient has surpassed the 300-mark threshold and now you’ve become a shoot-to-kill target to Inspectors and Enforcers from the Crime Investigation Department of the Ministry of Welfare’s Public Safety Bureau. The majority of the story is not told from the civilians’ point of view but from that of some of the Inspectors and Enforcers as they encounter outstanding circumstances and learn more about the true nature of the Sybil System.</p><h2 id=h-available-versions-of-the-original-psycho-pass data-injectable=false>Available versions of the original Psycho-Pass</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/215219.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>There are two versions of the original&nbsp;Psycho-Pass&nbsp;available. A regular version and an Extended Edition. This Extended Edition takes the 22-episode season and turns it into an 11-episode season, with each episode being 45 minutes long.&nbsp;These episodes include some new footage. They also give the whole season a visual upgrade that fixes some noticeable animation issues seen in the original, making it a perfect Blu-ray experience.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>If you have access to the Extended Edition, you may want to watch that instead of the older version that aired over a decade ago. It is often hailed as being the better of the two, as the added scenes help flesh out the characters and provide a bit more context.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-psycho-pass-in-release-order data-injectable=false>How to watch Psycho-Pass in release order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/13409698.jpg><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>The easiest way to watch&nbsp;Psycho-Pass&nbsp;is to watch it in the order of release. To view&nbsp;Psycho-Pass&nbsp;in release order, follow this list:&nbsp;</p><ul data-current-count=574.5 data-injectable=true><li>Psycho-Pass&nbsp;(2012)</li><li>Psycho-Pass 2&nbsp;(2014)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: The Movie&nbsp;(2015)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass 3&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector&nbsp;(2020)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Providence (2023)</li></ul><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Although the story can be experienced in this order, this would not be an entirely linear way to follow it, mainly because Providence is not the one set farthest in the chronology, but serves as a sort of prequel to the third season. Nothing is lost, however, if you decide to go this route. It will just influence the knowledge – or lack thereof – you have going into season 3.</p><h2 id=h-a-note-about-psycho-pass-sinners-of-the-system data-injectable=false>A note about Psycho-Pass: Sinners Of The System&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Psycho-Pass: Sinners Of The System&nbsp;is a collection of three short films, each running for 60 minutes.

Fans usually deem the third movie to be the best of the trilogy, in great part due to its focus on a particular fan-favorite character. Aside from Case 2 which gives backstory to a certain character before they joined the Public Safety Bureau, the Cases follow a linear chronology.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-psycho-pass-in-chronological-order data-injectable=false>How to watch Psycho-Pass in chronological order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/220650.jpg><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>Psycho-Pass&nbsp;had an easy-to-follow chronology, which made it easy to watch in chronological order.&nbsp;That is until Psycho-Pass: Providence came along – outside of its brief 2023 cinema release, the movie was, for a time, impossible to find available for streaming, likely due to the tricky nature of movie rights over TV series’ rights – which is set prior to the events of season 3, even answering some of the questions that had been left unanswered by the time skip between seasons. “It is in this untold story that the missing link is revealed.” says the last line of the official synopsis.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=93 data-injectable=false>To watch&nbsp;Psycho-Pass&nbsp;in chronological order, watch it in the following order:&nbsp;</p><ul data-current-count=751.5 data-injectable=true><li>Psycho-Pass&nbsp;(2012)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System: Case.2: First Guardian&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass 2&nbsp;(2014)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: The Movie&nbsp;(2015)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System: Case.1: Crime and Punishment&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System: Case.3: On the Other Side of Love and Hate&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass: Providence</li><li>Psycho-Pass 3&nbsp;(2019)</li><li>Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector&nbsp;(2020)</li></ul><h2 id=h-where-to-watch-psycho-pass data-injectable=false>Where to watch Psycho-Pass</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/13407505.jpg><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Psycho-Pass&nbsp;has had a rocky release history in America.
