Somehow, though, as the DC corner of Warner Bros. wraps up its decade-long strategy of throwing everything at the wall, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the critical consensus</a> seems to be that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Beetle</a> </strong>is what stuck.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>If nothing else, it’s appropriate that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Beetle became the face of success</a> in the wake of DC’s cinematic womp-womps. Like so many characters from Detective Comics, he’s the result of half a dozen reimaginings and reboots and crises, deaths, and returns from the grave.</p><h2 id=h-jaime-reyes-the-blue-beetle data-injectable=false>Jaime Reyes: The Blue Beetle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blue-Beetle-3.png><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>The Blue Beetle featured in the 2023 movie of the same name is Jaime Reyes, and he’s a fresh face on the comic book scene. First introduced 17 years ago, he was the brainchild of Red co-creator Cully Hamner, The Librarians writer John Rogers, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">genuine superhero royalty Keith Giffen</a>. Reyes shared most of his DNA with the version who made it to the big screen: A Mexican-American kid in a Texas town, fused with a glowy blue alien bug thing, protecting the innocent through the use of powers that he doesn’t fully understand. He’s Green Lantern meets The Greatest American Hero. He’s fun.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>This iteration of the character hit newsstands in 2006, and he hit those newsstands hard. Before long the Reyes Blue Beetle was popping up in all sorts of media — Batman: The Brave and the Bold in 2008, Smallville in 2011, and the triple-A NetherRealm superhero fighter Injustice 2 in 2017.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>And while contemporary comics, movies, games, and shows have made the modern Blue Beetle a star player, he’s not the first character to go by the name.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ted Kord — also The Blue Beetle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blue-Beetle-2.png><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Before Jaime Reyes became the Blue Beetle in 2006, the title belonged to a guy named Ted Kord — if you saw the movie, you’ll know that his existence was alluded to in the sort of voice cameo that guys in their 30s like to explain to someone on the car ride home from what will later turn out to be their last date.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Kord was a niche character for nerds with specific tastes, thanks in large part to Keith Giffen, the writer who helped create Jaime Reyes years later. First appearing in Charlton Comics’ Captain Atom stories in 1966, he came from the imagination of Steve Ditko, co-creator of Spider-Man. Like Reyes, he had access to the Scarab. Unlike Reyes, he never really got the thing to work right.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>Instead, Kord dressed up as his own version of the Blue Beetle, fighting crime with gadgets like super-bright flashlights, Airzookas, and a bug-shaped flying machine. He was the inspiration for Nite Owl from Watchmen, if that helps — everything you saw Nite Owl do was pretty much a bird-themed version of Blue Beetle’s schtick. Well, you know. Everything except that one scene.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Kord was weird. Kord stayed weird. Kord made the jump from Charlton to DC in the ‘80s and quickly found a home as half of a zany duo with the time-traveling ego monster Booster Gold. He was never DC’s most famous hero, and you definitely got the feeling that most of the people he saved were just being polite when they acted like they knew who he was. Even so, he retains a devoted fan base.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Do you know who didn’t retain a devoted fan base? The Blue Beetle before him. That’s right, this isn’t over until I say it’s over.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dan Garrett — also also The Blue Beetle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bb1.png><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Ted Kord begat Jaime Reyes, and Dan Garrett begat Ted Kord.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>Dan Garrett’s origins take us all the way back to the 1930s. The character debuted in Mystery Men Comics in August, 1939, and he couldn’t have been more era-appropriate. All the pulpy tropes were there: A cop by day, Garrett received enhanced strength and vitality through the ingestion of vitamin pills. He donned a double-breasted suit and wide-brimmed fedora and fought crime in a way that probably made kids at the time say “Gosh, that sure seems like the writers just aped The Green Hornet.”</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Garrett would get a re-think, becoming an adventurer and archaeologist, given vague superpowers through the discovery of a mystical scarab found in an Egyptian tomb. The scarab would eventually be passed down to Garrett’s student, Ted Kord.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=false>While it took time to get the perfect Blue Beetle in the comics, we should thank our lucky stars that his on-screen adaptation did not aim for a similar trial-and-error methodology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1prqMsJisZZKhwqZ5wZ6craSVYrCzscCtnJ1lmpa2rrGMq5yynaNisaR5x6KqraeirnqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bowen-byram-girlfriend-kailey-rankin-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Bowen Byram Girlfriend Kailey Rankin | Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./air-fryer-zucchini.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Air Fryer Zucchini - Mom On Timeout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
