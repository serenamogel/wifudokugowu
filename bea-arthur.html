A Tony Award-winning actress, she appeared on All the in Family, and her character Maude received a spin-off show which dealt with topics like women's rights and abortion. In 1985, Arthur starred in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/golden-girls-facts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Golden Girls" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Golden Girls</a>, one of the few series to feature a cast of actresses over the age of 40. Arthur died in 2009.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Actress and comedienne Bea Arthur was born Bernice Frankel on May 13, 1922, in New York City. Known for her sharp wit, Arthur first attracted notice for her performance in the off-Broadway production of The Threepenny Opera in 1954. She continued to find success performing on stage. She originated the role of Yente the matchmaker in Fiddler on the Roof in 1964. Arthur even won the 1966 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Vera Charles in Mame. She reprised the role for the 1974 film version.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Commercial Success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A guest appearance on All the in Family, Norman Lear's groundbreaking situation comedy led to Arthur's first television series. Audiences loved her character Maude Findlay, the outspoken liberal cousin of Edith Bunker. The spin-off series <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/maude-abortion-storyline-bea-arthur data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Maude class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Maude</a> ran for six seasons, starting in 1972. The show began with Maude moving to Washington, D.C., to serve as a member of Congress. With its strong female lead, it was a timely program, picking up on women's rights and issues of the era. The show didn't shy away from controversial topics, including abortion. The well-regarded comedy won Arthur her first Emmy Award in 1977 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She had been nominated three times for Maude before her big win.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It would be seven years until Bea Arthur found another smash television series. This time she played Dorothy Zbornak, a divorced older woman living with friends and looking after her mother on Golden Girls. Set in Miami, the comedy followed the lives, loves, and misadventures of these women. The ensemble included veteran performers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://next-fre.biography.com/actors/betty-white data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Betty White" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Betty White</a> and Rue McClanahan - who had worked with Arthur on Maude. Estelle Getty played Arthur's mother despite the fact that the two were around the same age. The show had the distinction of being one of the few series in television history to feature a cast of actresses over the age of 40.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A hit with television audiences, the cast of Golden Girls also garnered praise from critics and peers. During its seven-year run, all four stars won Emmy Awards for their work on the series. Arthur received the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1988. Although the show ended in 1992, it remains popular, being shown in syndication.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Golden Girls ended, Arthur made a few guest appearances on television, including Malcolm in the Middle and Curb Your Enthusiasm. She also toured with her own one-woman show, And Then There's Bea in 2001. In 2002, she appeared in Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends, which earned her a Tony Award nomination for Special Theatrical Event. She lost out to Elaine Stritch, who ironically had been up for the role of Dorothy on Golden Girls along with Arthur.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of acting, Bea Arthur was a strong supporter of animal rights and an activist for AIDS-related causes. And, thanks in part to Arthur's generosity, in 2016, an 18-bed home for homeless LGBT youth named in her honor, the Bea Arthur Residence, will open in New York City.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Arthur was married twice and had two sons with second husband Gene Saks. The couple was married in 1950 and divorced in 1978. Arthur died at her home in Los Angeles on April 25, 2009, of cancer. She was 86.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Arthur</li><li>Birth Year: 1922</li><li>Birth date: May 13, 1922</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: New York</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Bea Arthur was an Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress who starred in the television shows 'Maude' and 'The Golden Girls.'</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Television</li><li>Theater and Dance</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Taurus</li><li>Death Year: 2009</li><li>Death date: April 25, 2009</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Los Angeles</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Bea Arthur Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/bea-arthur</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&E Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 30, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrsSaZJqqpJ3Csw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lovie-smith-past-teams-coached-beard-net-worth-salary-family-record-with-bears-texans-contract.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lovie Smith Past Teams Coached, Beard, Net Worth, Salary, Family, Record With Bears, Texans Contract</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alice-zenobia-richmonds-parents-have-been-married-for-two-decades.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alice Zenobia Richmonds Parents Have Been Married For Two Decades</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
