So, in the interest of spreading this magnificent creation as far and wide as possible, here’s <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>how to get the Starbucks emoji keyboard</a>. It’s not quite as simple as just downloading an app, but as long as you’re willing to take the additional steps needed to enable the thing, it’s totally worth it. Look — I’ve even put together a set of step-by-step instructions for you to make it as easy as possible. You’re welcome.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Starbucks emoji keyboard</a> debuted on Monday, and honestly, I’m just wondering why it took so long for it to be a thing in the first place. The options are quite clever, too — in addition to emoji representing <a href=# class=T3D>your favorite drinks</a>, a Starbucks storefront, and the ubiquitous green mermaid logo, there are also some fun riffs on classic emoji: Raised hands praising a Frappuccino, for example, and a couple of <a href=# class=T3D>the emoji faces</a> we all know and love sipping beverages of their own. The keyboard is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>available for both iOS</a> <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>and Android devices</a>, and the emoji are usable not only in text messages and emails, but also in WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and other smartphone messaging platforms. It just goes to show that <a href=# class=T3D>coffee truly is the universal language</a>.</p><p>Here’s how to snag the Starbucks emoji keyboard for your very own. Did I mention that it’s free? Because it is. And who doesn’t love free stuff?</p><h3>1. Download the Keyboard</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Technically this first step encompasses a couple of smaller steps, so for the curious, here’s what those smaller steps are: First, open up the app store on your phone. (For me, that’s the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>iTunes App Store,</a> but if you’ve got an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Android, Google Play</a> will work as well.) Then, search for any of the following: “Starbucks emoji,” “Starbucks emojis,” “Starbucks keyboard,” or “Starbucks emoji keyboard.” Tap “GET,” then “Install” if you’re on an iPhone like me; if, however, you’re on an Android phone, then do whatever the equivalent is there.</p><h3>2. Open the App and Read the Instructions</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>I was still on the app’s product screen in the iTunes App Store, so I just tapped “OPEN” after it finished installing. I also told the app not to send me push notifications when the prompt for that option popped up automatically, but that’s just because I limit my push notifications to things that might actually be important. Feel free to choose the opposite, of course.</p><p>Remember how they always used to tell you in school to read through your entire test before you started taking it? Same principle applies here. Just keep swiping to read the instructions for how to enable the keyboard.</p><h3>3. Go to “Settings,” Then “General”</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Enabling the Starbucks emoji keyboard works in pretty much the same way as <a href=# class=T3D>enabling the Japanese keyboard</a>. First, open your “Settings” menu and tap “General.” (It’s right towards the bottom of the screen for me, about three options up from the bottom.)</p><h3>5. Go to “Keyboard,” Then “Keyboards”</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>You’ll have to scroll down a little to find the “Keyboard” menu; it’s sandwiched between “Date & Time” and “Language & Region” on my iPhone. Once you’ve gotten into the initial “Keyboard” menu, tap “Keyboards” (right up at the top).</p><h3>6. Tap “Add New Keyboard”</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>This step is self-explanatory.</p><h3>7. Add the Starbucks Keyboard</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Under “Third-Party Keyboards,” you should see the Starbucks one. Tap it to add it; then once it’s appeared in your Keyboards list, tap it again and toggle the “Allow Full Access” switch on. Tap "Allow" when the pop-up window seen above shows up.</p><h3>8. Enjoy Your Stylish and Caffeinated Emoji</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>To use your brand new coffee-themed emoji, just open up a text message, email, WhatsApp message, etc.; then tap the little globe icon in the bottom left hand corner until the Starbucks keyboard pops up. (I had to tap it three times — once to get to the Apple emoji keyboard, once to get to <a href=# class=T3D>the Shruggie keyboard</a>, and once to get to the Starbucks one.) Once you can see the keyboard, tap the emoji you want to use, then press and hold the message field and select “paste.” Voila! A bottled Frappuccino, a dancing lady with coffee, and a cat sipping a delicious-looking beverage are yours to use as you see fit.</p><p><i>Images: Lucia Peters/Bustle (9)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZVvcHBlmKTEbsDOZp6erF2ptaZ50q2Yq5qlmLi0ecSmpqOhXaCyuq7OmqmdZZKasKLB0p5ksqelp3qttcWeZKKrnql6pLvMqaOerJVixKrAx6isrWWRYrCiwIyfmJyd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cherry-cheesecake-magic-ice-cream.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cherry Cheesecake Magic Ice Cream</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-garner-height-how-tall-is-jennifer-garner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Tall Is Jennifer Garner?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
