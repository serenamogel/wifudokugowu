He is the founder and CEO of “KeyQuaad” – a record label that the musician signed to in 2019.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Valo Ngaji set out to re-write the African story through music and so identified the potential of Omah Lay in 2019. He would go on to sign him to the KeyQuaad record label founded in 2018. The label helped Lay release songs such as Woman (2022), and Godly (2021) to mention a few.</p><p>In spite of this, there are suggestions that Damilola Akinwumi of Dapper Music is the actual and perhaps current boss of Omah Lay. Judging by this, Omah Lay may be associated with 2 men as music bosses. In any case, here is every detail to know about the Nigerian music star’s boss(es).</p><h2><strong>Who is Omah Lay’s Record Label Boss?</strong></h2><p>Born Stanley Omah Didia, Omah Lay probably has 2 bosses – or maybe not. The 2 men are Valentino “Valo” Ngaji and Damilola Akinwunmi. This is a result of the counter-information that sources have given. While others claim that the singer is with Valo whom he was signed to in 2019, others claim that he was later signed to Dapper Music.</p><p>There is a further allegation, per Pulse.ng, that the You singer signed a record deal with Warner Group. Well, his most recent work, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Woman</a> was released in May 2022 through KeyQuaad. Going by this, it is safe to say the founder and CEO of the label is his boss.</p><h3><strong>What to Know About the Relationship Between Omah Lay and Valo</strong></h3><p>Outside of music, the two men attended the same institution – the University of Port Harcourt. Even though they may not have been in the school at the same time or even studied the same course, they <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>share an alumni</a> relationship.</p><p>Delving into their relationship in music, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Valentine Ngaji signed</a> the 26 years old Omah Lay in June 2019. With the label, Valo helped the singer now worth between<a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal> $400-$600 thousand</a> release his foremost official single titled You&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p>Also, with the help of Valo, Omah Lay released his debut EP, “Get Layd” (2020). The EP immediately skyrocketed him to international stardom with hit singles such as Bad Influence. The song alone attracted Omah with the most-streamed Nigerian song on Apple Music in 2020.</p><p>Although it is not a necessity that all of Omah Lay’s songs and EPs were produced by Valo Ngaji, the singer released them under Valentine’s label.</p><p><strong>Some of Omah Lay’s songs under his boss</strong></p><ul><li>Woman (2022)</li><li>Attention Ft. Justin Beiber (2022)</li><li>Understand (2021)</li><li>Lo Lo (2020)</li><li>Godly (2020)</li><li>Bad Influence (2020)</li><li>Damn (2020)</li><li>You (2020)</li></ul><p><strong>Through the Contributions of Omah Lay boss, the singer, and producer has won awards and honors such as:</strong></p><ul><li>Afro X Digitals Awards for Break Out of the Year (2021)</li><li>Net Honours for Most Played Song (Godly, 2021)</li><li>The Headies for Next Rated (2020)</li><li>He was the first artist highlighted for Apple’s Africa Rising Campaign (2020)</li><li>BBC includes Lay in its BBC Radio 1Xtra’s annual Hot for 2021 list (December 2020)</li><li>Lay was named BET’s Amplified Artist of the Month (November 2020)</li><li>The artist signed by Valentine Ngaji became the first African featured on Audiomack’s #Up Now program for emerging artists</li></ul><h2><strong>The Relationship Between the Godly Singer and His Other “Boss”</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BuzzNigeria-40.jpg><p>Damilola is the founder and CEO of Dapper Music – a Nigerian distribution company and record label that was founded in 2017. He was believed to have signed Omah sometime between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.</p><p>This claim, even though it has been reported by several outlets, including BBC pidgin, there is still barely any confirmation from Omah Lay. There’s is also a report that he left KeyQuad in Port Harcourt and headed for Lagos where <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>he signed to Dapper</a>.</p><p>Even with the reports, the evidence of KeyQaad as his label continues to show through his music videos that carry the logo and name of the brand. However, Dami’s label is known for music marketing, talent managing, analytics, marketing, and distribution of music. By this, there is perhaps a relationship between Damilola, a University of Lagos graduate, and the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Delta State</a>-born artist.</p><p>Judging based on the Instagram posts of “Dapper”, the label mostly distributes Lays works. In addition, the official website of Dapper has listed Omah Lay as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>one of its clients</a>. Others listed are Skiibi, Ice Prince, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Teni</a>, and Mr. Real. Although these artists have worked closely with Dapper, it is only Skiibi that reportedly signed to the label.</p><h3><strong>Does Omah Lay Have an Affiliation with an International Record Label?</strong></h3><p>As the story goes, Omah Lay may have another boss by signing to Sire Records under Warner Group for international distribution. The record label is currently headed by Rani Hancock. He became the president of the brand in 2017 and 3 years later, the label would <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>reportedly sign Lay</a>.</p><p>Warner Group had previously partnered with Nigerian label, Choc City to work with artists such as <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Ice Prince</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Brymo</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>M.I</a>, and Jesse Jagz among others.</p><h3><strong>Is Omah Lay in YBNL Record Label?</strong></h3><p class=my-0.5>Omah Lay is not signed to YBNL Record Label. Omah Lay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter, is signed to KeyQaad, an independent record label based in Nigeria. YBNL (Yahoo Boy No Laptop) Record Label is owned by Nigerian rapper and singer Olamide.</p><p class=my-0.5>Although it has been home to several prominent Nigerian artists, Omah Lay is not one of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571qGmZqGjYryurcdmo5qxXZe8tL%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christian-bale-addresses-one-of-the-many-american-psycho-urban-legends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christian Bale addresses one of the many American Psycho urban legends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-andrew-east-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-2-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andrew East?
