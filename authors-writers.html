He published his first children's book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, under the name of Dr. Seuss in 1937.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Next came a string of bestsellers, including The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham. His rhymes and characters are beloved by generations of fans.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Geisel was born on March 2, 1904, in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father, Theodor Robert Geisel, was a successful brewmaster; his mother was Henrietta Seuss Geisel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 18, Geisel left home to attend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://home.dartmouth.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dartmouth College" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dartmouth College</a>, where he became the editor in chief of its humor magazine, Jack-O-Lantern. When Geisel and his friends were caught drinking in his dorm room one night, in violation of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/prohibition data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Prohibition class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prohibition</a> law, he was kicked off the magazine staff, but continued to contribute to it using the pseudonym "Seuss."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from Dartmouth, Geisel attended the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ox.ac.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="University of Oxford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">University of Oxford</a> in England, with plans to eventually become a professor. In 1927, he dropped out of Oxford.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career as a Cartoonist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Upon returning to America, Geisel decided to pursue cartooning full-time. His articles and illustrations were published in numerous magazines, including LIFE and Vanity Fair. A cartoon that he published in the July 1927 issue of The Saturday Evening Post, his first using the pen name "Seuss," landed him a staff position at the New York weekly Judge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Geisel next worked for Standard Oil in the advertising department, where he spent the next 15 years. His ad for Flit, a popular insecticide, became nationally famous.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Viking Press offered Geisel a contract to illustrate a children's collection called Boners. The book sold poorly, but it gave him a break into children's literature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the start of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/world-war-ii-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a>, Geisel began contributing weekly political cartoons to the liberal publication PM Magazine. In 1942, too old for the World War II draft, Geisel served with Frank Capra's Signal Corps, making animated training films and drawing propaganda posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY2NzA3NDM0MTE3NjcwMTYz/drseuss_facts_desktop.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S DR.

Some of his more well-known works include:</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Dr. Seuss’ First Book</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, was rejected 27 times before it was finally published by Vanguard Press in 1937.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Horton Hears a Who!' (1954)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1954, Geisel published this comic classic, which teaches kindness and perseverance from Horton the elephant, features the famous line “a person’s a person, no matter how small.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Cat in the Hat' (1957)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A major turning point in Geisel's career came when, in response to a 1954 LIFE magazine article that criticized children's reading levels, Houghton Mifflin and Random House asked him to write a children's primer using 220 vocabulary words.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The resulting book, The Cat in the Hat, was published in 1957 and was described by one critic as a "tour de force." The success of The Cat in the Hat cemented Geisel's place in children's literature.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' (1957)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot . . . but the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-ville, did NOT!” For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of the mountain. This tale, where citizens of Who-ville warm the Grinch to the spirit of Christmas, encourages young readers to do their own good deeds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The book was successful in the 1950s and 1960s but became an instant holiday classic when it was released in 1966 as a made-for-TV cartoon special featuring the voice of Boris Karloff.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Green Eggs and Ham' (1960)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Do you like green eggs and ham?” Readers follow Sam-I-Am as he adds (and adds) to the list of places to enjoy green eggs and ham and the friends to enjoy them with. The book is written for early readers, with simple words, rhymes and lots of illustrations.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish' (1960)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"Did you ever fly a kite in bed? Did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?" Another of Geisel's simple rhyming plots about a boy and a girl and their adventures with their colorful cast of friends and pets, like Gox to the winking Yink who drinks pink ink.”</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Dr. Seuss’s ABC: An Amazing Alphabet Book!' (1963)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The littlest readers learn their ABCs, from Aunt Annie's Alligator to a Zizzer-Zazzer-Zuzz with playful, nonsensical illustrations and text.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Fox in Socks' (1965)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In this silly book, Fox in Socks teaches Knox in a box hilarious tongue-twisters that are best read aloud, like “Socks on chicks and chicks on fox. Fox on clocks on bricks and blocks. Bricks and blocks on Knox on box.”</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Lorax' (1971)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"UNLESS someone like you...cares a whole awful lot...nothing is going to get better...It's not." In this book, Geisel warns of the dangers of mistreating the environment before environmentalism was a trend. The cautionary tale teaches young readers about the beauty of the natural world and their duty to protect it.</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Oh, the Places You’ll Go!' (1990)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Published in 1990, the year before Geisel's death, this book is the classic sendoff for kids of all ages, from kindergarteners to college students. Dr. Seuss teaches readers that success is within you, illustrating life’s inevitable highs and lows.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Other books by Geisel include If I Ran the Zoo (1950), winner of the Caldecott Honor, and Hop on Pop (1963). Dr. Seuss was also an editor of P.D. Eastman’s classic, Are You My Mother? (1960), which was part of his Beginner Books series.</p><img alt="Dr. Seuss Photo" title="Dr. Seuss Photo" width=2088 height=3041 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/GettyImages-50478491.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: John Bryson/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images</span><p>Dr. Seuss with figurines from his children’s books</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several of Geisel's books have been transformed into full-length feature animated films, both during his lifetime and posthumously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1966, with the help of eminent cartoonist Chuck Jones, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas was adapted into an animated film made for TV.
