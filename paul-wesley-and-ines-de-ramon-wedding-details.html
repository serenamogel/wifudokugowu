Both of them were spotted in New York with a wedding ring on their finger.</p><p>The question still remains unanswered as to their marital status. They might've got engaged and still waiting for the right moment for the wedding. Paul is a very secretive person, so because of that, he has not cared to answer any queries related to his girlfriend.</p><h2>The Gold Wedding Band is the Proof</h2><p>In February 2019, Wesley stepped out with his girlfriend, <strong>Ines De Ramon</strong> in New York City. It's just been several months the couple started dating each other. In such a short period of time, they have grown so much close to each other that they probably married.</p><p>While walking down the New York road, a photographer for <i>E! News</i> spotted them together. On his left hand, Paul wore a simple gold band while his girl showed a large diamond ring. With that evidence, we can say that <i>The Vampire Diaries</i> actor is now officially off the market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/23/Paul%20wedding-1569229754577.jpg><p>If it is the case, then, Paul did a great job in keeping his wedding a secret affair. The details of the ceremony are not disclosed to anyone, but some online tabloids say the pair exchanged wedding vows in New York City itself. Ines is Wesley's third love; Prior to her, Paul was in a relationship twice.&nbsp;</p><h2>How did the affair start?</h2><p>After Paul's break-up with his model girlfriend, he started his romantic affair with Ines. The couple has stayed silent on how they met each other, but the paparazzi first spotted the pair in June 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Wesley and Ines were enjoying a romantic dinner at <i>Big Apple </i>where the paparazzi spotted them. As of now, it's been a year to their relationship, but they have not made any public appearances together.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/23/Paul%20twitter%20one-1569229935028.jpg><p>The actor, however, posts a few pics of Ines on his Instagram. On the other hand, Ines stays away from any social media platform, so there are not many details about her personal life.</p><h2>Paul's Previous Relationships</h2><p>Prior to hopelessly falling in love with Ines, the <i>Killer Movie</i> star tied the knot with his co-star <strong>Torrey DeVitto</strong> in 2011. The couple met each other on the <i>Killer movie</i> sets where they loved each other's company.</p><p>After some distinctive period of dating, the pair walked down the aisle in April 2011. The duo enjoyed their married life for almost two years, but in July 2013, because of irreconcilable differences, the pair separated.</p><p>In just after two months of his split with Torrey, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Paul started his affair with Vampire Diaries actress Phoebe Tonkin.</a> The pair began their affair from September 2013 and ended the relationship in October 2017. The relationship ended along with the final season of <i>Vampire Diaries</i> where he featured alongside <strong>Nina Dobrev</strong>, <a href=#>David Alpay</a>, <strong>Kat Graham</strong>, and many more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/23/Paul%20and%20second%20girlfriend-1569229673070.jpg><p>In an interview with<i> Elle Canada</i>, Tonkin talked about his on-and-off boyfriend, Wesley. She said,</p><p>"He's my best friend. It's such a fun time in my life right now. It's nice to have someone to share all that with".</p><p>Apart from these two, Wesley also dated American actress <a href=#>Sarah Snyder</a> for a brief period of time. Paul is currently enjoying his possible married life with Ines De Ramon and is enjoying his work.</p><p><strong>For further updates, keep reading </strong><a href=#>MarriedCeleb</a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqmYrqRdrLK0uMSyZJqmlGK2r7HSZpueZaKWurC6jLCcnZyZo7RusMStmKKkow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-tobi-lerone-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All About Tobi Lerone | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-paul-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Paul Net Worth: Music &amp;amp; Income</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
