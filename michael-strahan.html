After playing for Texas Southern University, Strahan was selected by the New York Giants in the 1993 NFL draft. Over the course of his long career, Strahan became one of the league's all-time QB sack leaders. Following his retirement in 2008, Strahan eased into a new career in television. In September 2012, Strahan became the new co-host of the morning television program Live! With Kelly and Michael and later moved to Good Morning America.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Michael Anthony Strahan was born on November 21, 1971, in Houston, Texas. The youngest of six children, Strahan spent a good portion of his childhood in Mannheim, Germany, where his father, Gene, an Army major, settled the family when Strahan was 9 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A gifted athlete with a tall frame, Strahan returned to Texas for his senior year of high school. Although he had played organized football in Germany, Strahan lacked the experience of the other players he competed against as a member of the Westbury High School team. Still, he proved to be gifted enough in the sport to earn a scholarship to play at Texas Southern University in Houston.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a college player, Strahan continued to make incredible strides. He dominated the line of scrimmage, barreling through offensive lines and terrorizing opposing quarterbacks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By his senior year, Strahan's play had caught the attention of NFL scouts. In the spring of 1993, the talented defensive player was selected 40th overall in the NFL draft, by the New York Giants.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Pro Football Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As he had in high school and college, Strahan, who stands at 6'5", was quick to adapt to the competition and his new football environment. During his second year in the league, he became a full-time starter for the Giants. He registered his first double-digit quarterback sack season in 1997, with 14, earning his first trip to the Pro Bowl for his efforts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the next decade, Strahan proved to be a dominating defensive force for the Giants. Following a 15-sack campaign in 1998, he set an NFL single-season record with 22.5 sacks in 2001. Strahan would eventually compile a total of 141.5 quarterback sacks, ranking fifth in NFL history at the time of his final game.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Strahan's career ended on a high note. After mulling retirement, the star veteran returned to the Giants for the 2007 season. That year, along with quarterback <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/eli-manning data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eli Manning" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eli Manning</a>, Strahan led the club to its first Super Bowl victory in nearly two decades, with an upset win over <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/tom-brady data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Brady" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tom Brady</a> and the undefeated New England Patriots in the championship game.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after the big victory, Strahan announced his retirement from football. "I just hope people can say he was a great defensive end, he helped us win, he's a motivator, he's a team leader," Strahan told reporters. "And you're going to miss me when I leave."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Television Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even before Strahan had left the game of football, it was generally believed that he had a future in television. Following his retirement, Strahan was hired as a football analyst with FOX Sports. He's also done several commercials for the Subway sandwich chain.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Live! With Kelly and Michael'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the fall of 2009, Strahan starred in the short-lived FOX sitcom Brothers. Then in September 2012, Strahan was named the new co-host of Live! With Kelly. Filling the spot formerly held by longtime host <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/regis-philbin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Regis Philbin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Regis Philbin</a>, he teamed up with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kelly-ripa data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Ripa" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kelly Ripa</a> on the syndicated show, which was renamed Live! With Kelly and Michael.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Move to 'Good Morning America'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Strahan was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in early 2014. In April of the same year, he joined Good Morning America as a part-time correspondent. In April 2016, ABC announced that Strahan was leaving Live! With Kelly and Michael to join Good Morning America on a full-time basis. The move was surprising and controversial, considering Ripa learned of his plan to exit just minutes before going on air. Needless to say, it had put a strain on their relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/923988/michael-strahan-wouldn-t-change-a-thing-about-his-live-with-kelly-exit data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2018 interview with E!" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">2018 interview with E!</a>, Strahan said he had no regrets.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"There's nothing I would have done differently," he confessed. "I handled it as professional as you can handle it and I have been a professional from day one there to the last day I left… I had the opportunity to do something that most people don't — I get a chance to evolve; to do different, creative things."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the fall of 2018, he became the new co-host of GMA Day's third-hour slot with Sara Haines, former panelist of The View. In 2019, the show added actress Keke Palmer as a third co-host and the show was renamed Strahan, Sara and Keke.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Strahan was married twice, first to Wanda Hutchins (1992-1996) and then to Jean Muggli (1999-2006). He's the father of four children. In 2009, he became engaged to Nicole Murphy, former wife of actor and comedian <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/eddie-murphy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eddie Murphy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eddie Murphy</a>.
