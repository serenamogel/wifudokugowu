On the other hand, Kisha defends her decision, stating that it’s her body and her choice, and she has the right to do as she pleases.</span></p><p><span>After the leak, the video quickly gained traction on social media. Initially surfacing on Reddit, it soon spread to other platforms like Twitter. The public weighed in on the couple’s fiery disagreement and their contrasting views.
