This popular American rapper and actor is recognized under his stage name of Chingy. The mentioned above occupations are the main ones when it comes to accumulating Chingy’s net worth. He might be called a wordly wise performer as Chingy has already been on the stage for more than 15 years, since 1997.</p><h3>Chingy Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>How rich is Chingy? Sources have reported that the overall amount of Chingy’s net worth is as much as $12 million, an amount growing steadily as the rapper earns about $1.8 million annually. Analyzing the earnings received from the sales of albums it can be clearly noticed that the most profitable album is the mixtape “Chances Make Champions” which has added $1.25 million to the wealth of the performer. The rapper has earned more than $4.46 million from all his album sales.</p><p>Music, and to be precise, rapping has been Chingy’s passion from early adolescence. As a teenager he performed and recorded songs under the stage name H Thugz, including performing in the band Without Warning. Thereafter, he changed his stage name and pursued his solo career. Chingy began performing as an opening act when he was out of his teens. Soon, he was noticed by <a href=#>Ludacris</a>, the famous rapper and entrepreneur, who has helped Chingy to pursue his career, signing a contract with <a href=#>Ludacris</a>’ record label called Disturbing the Peace. In a while, the first album “Jackpot” (2003) was released which was a perfect introduction to the music world. The album found its place in American music charts as well as becoming popular in Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The album received certifications in almost all the above-mentioned countries, meaning that the net worth of the rapper received a huge financial injection, too. The following albums “Powerballin’” (2004) and “Hoodstar” (2006) were not a patch of the success compared with the first one. However, they were respectively certified platinum and gold in the USA. The fourth studio album “Hate It or Love It” was the least successful of all four. Currently, the rapper is working on an upcoming album “Chingology” which is expected to increase his net worth.</p><p>In addition to being a successful rapper, Chingy is also an actor. Since 2005, he has appeared in several feature films and television series. He has had small roles in the following films “The System Within” (2006), “Scary Movie 4” (2006), “Psycho” (2008), “Speed Dating” (2010) and other films. Chingy has played himself in many television series including the sitcoms “My Wife and Kids” (2005), “<a href=#>George Lopez</a>” (2005), the reality series “Punk’d (2005), “Yo Mamma” (2005) and “Couples Therapy” (2010). These diversions have added revenues to the wealth of Chingy, too.</p><p>Having a squint at his romantic relationships, Chingy had a long term relationship with the actress <a href=#>Keshia Knight Pulliam</a>. In 2005, he married his wife Adrienne Anderson Bailey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jpyfoqaXrnqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melissa-villasenor-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa Villaseor Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-gillespie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Gillespie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bella-lambert-net-worth-2024.html>Bella Lambert Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-crucible-tongs-and-beaker-tongs-html.html>What is the difference between crucible tongs and Beaker tongs?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-esco-jouley-everything-to-know-about-the-actress.html>Who Is Esco Jouley?
